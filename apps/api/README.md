# Backend

This is a placeholder Express server. Replace with MedusaJS when installing dependencies.
It includes minimal in-memory data and JWT authentication with a few sample endpoints.

To install dependencies (requires internet):

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

`pnpm start` assumes `NODE_ENV=production`.
